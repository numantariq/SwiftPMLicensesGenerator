# SwiftPMLicensesGenerator

A Swift Package to extract dependecies and licenses defined by SwiftPM. 
License is read from {Derived Data}/{App Folder}/SourcePackages/checkout. This is the path where Xcode checks out SPM dependencies. A license is only returned if the dependency has added a license file at the root of it's repo.
Rest of the information about the dependencies is extracted from the `Package.resolved` file. It can be found at following paths:

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Licences Generator

The `LicencesGenerator` is a command-line tool designed to generate a list of licenses for dependencies added via Swift Package Manager by specifying the path to an Xcode project file. The tool automatically locates the `Package.resolved` file based on the provided project file path and generates a JSON file containing the licenses information.

Hereâ€™s how to run the generator from the command line from a folder with an Xcode project or Swift Package manager project.

```
swift run SwiftPMLicensesGenerator
```

#### Parameters
- `<ProjectPath>`: (Optional) Path to the root directory with either an Xcode project or a Swift Package Manager project. Defaults to current directory.
- `--output-json-file`: (Optional) Path to where the output JSON file should be written to. Defaults to the current directory with 'licenses.json'.
- `--custom-build-path`: (Optional) Specify a custom build directory path if not using the default DerivedData path. If provided, this path is used to locate the SourcePackages/checkouts directory.

### Output

The output JSON uses the following format:

```JSON
[
    {
        "license":"License Text",
        "name":"Package Name",
        "url":"URL where package is hosted",
        "organisation": "Only tested for github URLs"
        "version":"Version Number being used in the project"
    }
]
```

## Example usage

Assuming your Xcode project is located in current folder and you prefer to save the output in the current directory:

```
swift run SwiftPMLicensesGenerator
```

If you need to specify a custom build directory and a specific location for the output file:

```
swift run SwiftPMLicensesGenerator --custom-build-path /path/to/custom/build --output-json-file /path/to/output/licenses.json
```

## Note
